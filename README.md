# CI/CD Workshop

## CI/CD Part I - Introduction

The goal of the first part of the workshop is to build a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and Docker. The 
infrastructure needed for the workshop can be found in the docker folder and the workshop itself in the 
workshop-introduction folder.

## CI/CD Part II

The ambition is to develop a second part for more advanced CI/CD concepts.
