# Docker setup

This directory contains a Docker and docker-compose configuration for the basic infrastructure
for the CICD Workshop. It sets up a Jenkins master instance with a default configuration, a few 
simple build agents, and a plain Git server.

## How to run

### Prerequisites

* [Docker CE][1]
* [docker-compose][2]

### Start Jenkins and Git server

Begin by starting the project:

``` bash
$ docker-compose up -d
```

To access the Jenkins instance, open a browser and go to:
 
    http://localhost:80/

The default login credentials are:
 
    jenkins:jenkins

### Add you public key to the Git server

To be able to fetch from and push to the Git server, you will need to add your public key. If you do not already 
have an RSA keypair you need to generate one before doing this:

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

To add your public key to the Git server, copy it into the container and restart it:

```bash
$Â docker cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub docker_git-server_1:/git-server/keys
$ docker-compose restart git-server
```

To verify that you have access you should be able to run the following command and see the same output:

```bash
$ ssh git@localhost -p 2222

information about administrating Alpine systems.
See <http://wiki.alpinelinux.org>.

You can setup the system with the command: setup-alpine

You may change this message by editing /etc/motd.
